Write a C++ program create a calculator for an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /). The program should 
take two operands from user and performs the operation on those two operands depending upon 
the operator entered by user. Use a switch statement to select the operation. Finally, display the 
result.


#include<iostream>                                          //including header files
using namespace std;             //standard library
int main()                                                  //initializing main function
{
char c;                                                     //variable declearation
float n1,n2;
     cout<<"Enter the operation to be perform\n +\t-\t*\t/\t";//operation to be performed
     cin>>c;
     cout<<"Enter first number:\t";                           //printing first number
     cin>>n1;                                                 //scaning first number
     cout<<"Enter second number:\t";                          //printing second number
     cin>>n2;                                                 //scaning second number
     
     
switch (c)                                                    //using switch case
{
     case'+':cout<<n1+n2<<"\n";
     break;
     case'-':cout<<n1-n2<<"\n";
     break;
     case'*':cout<<n1*n2<<"\n";
     break;
     case'/':cout<<n1/n2<<"\n";
